# MovieLens20M Recommendation System Projects

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks in which I analyze the MovieLens20M dataset and implement various recommendation system models. The models include user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and others, alongside extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering.

The models are compared against those implemented in specialized libraries such as the Surprise Library and Spark MLlib, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of performance and methodology.

## Notebook Contents

1. **EDA.ipynb**: Exploratory Data Analysis of the MovieLens dataset.
2. **User-based_CF.ipynb**: Implementation and analysis of user-based collaborative filtering models.
3. **Item-based_CF.ipynb**: Implementation and analysis of item-based collaborative filtering models.
4. **MatrixFactorization.ipynb**: Matrix factorization models implemented from scratch.
5. **MatrixFactorization_Spark.ipynb**: Implementation of matrix factorization models using Spark MLlib.

## Dataset

The MovieLens dataset used in these analyses can be downloaded from Kaggle via the following link: [MovieLens 20M Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset)
